## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the FabCar blockchain application seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to [your-email@domain.com] with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Security patches released as soon as possible

### Security Considerations

#### Network Security
- All peer-to-peer communication is encrypted using TLS
- Certificate-based identity management
- Private key protection in secure wallets
- Network isolation using Docker containers

#### Smart Contract Security
- Input validation on all chaincode functions
- Access control through MSP (Membership Service Provider)
- Immutable transaction history
- Consensus-based validation

#### API Security
- **Note**: Current implementation uses pre-registered identities
- **Production Recommendation**: Implement proper authentication middleware
- Input sanitization and validation
- CORS configuration for web security

#### Known Limitations
- Solo consensus (single point of failure) - use Raft for production
- No built-in user authentication in API layer
- Default Docker network configuration
- Sample cryptographic materials included

### Security Best Practices for Deployment

#### Production Deployment
- Use Raft or Kafka consensus mechanism
- Implement proper user authentication and authorization
- Use production-grade TLS certificates
- Regular security audits and updates
- Proper key management and rotation
- Network segmentation and firewalls
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing

#### Development Environment
- Never use production keys in development
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use secure Docker configurations
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

### Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment and initial triage
3. **Day 3-7**: Detailed analysis and impact assessment
4. **Day 8-14**: Develop and test security patch
5. **Day 15+**: Release security update and public disclosure
